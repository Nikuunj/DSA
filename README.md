# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository ðŸš€

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This Java-centric repository contains a collection of commonly used data structures and algorithms to help you strengthen your programming skills.

## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing various data structures and algorithms in the Java programming language. Whether you're a Java enthusiast or looking to enhance your DSA skills, this resource is here to help.

## â˜• Languages

The implementations in this repository are exclusively in Java, the language that brings coffee and code together! â˜•

Feel free to contribute additional implementations or improvements in Java.

## ðŸ§  Algorithms

Explore a variety of algorithms including:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci sequence)

## ðŸ“¦ Data Structures

Discover implementations of fundamental data structures in Java, such as:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees)
- Hash Tables
- Stacks and Queues

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
